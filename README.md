# Miscellanaria

## **Miscellanaria** is a mod that aims to bring old and unreleased Terraria items, mechanics and features back, reworked and rebalanced for modern Terraria.

**This includes:**
- **First Fractal** - an original endgame Terraria sword
- **Luminite Axes, Hammers and Chainsaws**
- **Scythe, Soul Scythe and Icemourne**
- **Skull Bow**
- **Key Molds**
- **Unimplemented boss bags**
- **Color-Only Dye**
- **Orb of Light pet**
- **White Cultist banners**
- **Dreadnautilus Trophy**
**and more!**

This mod doesn't significantly affect the balance of vanilla game, so you can play it alongside other, larger content mods, such as [Thorium](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2909886416) or [Calamity](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2824688072) without any problems.
