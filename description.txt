Miscellanaria is a mod that aims to bring old and unreleased Terraria items, mechanics and features back, reworked and rebalanced for modern Terraria.

This includes:
- First Fractal - an original endgame Terraria sword
- Luminite Axes, Hammers and Chainsaws
- Scythe, Soul Scythe and Icemourne
- Skull Bow
- Key Molds
- Unimplemented boss bags
- Color-Only Dye
- Orb of Light pet
- White Cultist banners
- Dreadnautilus Trophy
and more!

This mod doesn't significantly affect the balance of vanilla game, so you can play it alongside other, larger content mods, such as Thorium or Calamity without any problems.
